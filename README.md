# LLMPages: Interactive Web Demonstrations

## Overview

LLMPages is a project designed to showcase the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by creating a collection of diverse, interactive web content. This project serves as a public GitHub Pages site, demonstrating various LLM-generated outputs ranging from creative writing to data analysis and graphical representations.

## Features

*   **Creative Storytelling:** A Brandon Sanderson-inspired short story, "ashravan.txt," offering a narrative continuation of a character's journey.
*   **Ethical Dilemma Resolution:** A JSON file, "dilemma.json," exploring a complex autonomous vehicle ethical scenario with defined parameters.
*   **Personal Branding:** A concise self-description, "about.md," presented in three impactful words.
*   **Vector Graphics Generation:** A unique SVG image, "pelican.svg," depicting a pelican engaged in an unusual activity.
*   **Location-Based Recommendations:** A JSON file, "restaurant.json," providing a curated restaurant recommendation for Kolkata.
*   **Economic Forecasting:** A JSON file, "prediction.json," offering a projection for the Federal Funds Rate with supporting reasoning.
*   **Centralized Homepage:** An "index.html" file that acts as a gateway, linking to all other project components and providing brief explanations.
*   **Project Licensing:** A standard MIT License file ensuring open and permissive use of the project's code and content.
*   **Attachment Upload:** Inclusion of a provided attachment, "uid.txt," as-is.

## Usage

This project is intended to be deployed as a static website on GitHub Pages. Once deployed, users can navigate to the GitHub Pages URL to access:

1.  The `index.html` homepage.
2.  Click on links from the homepage to view each of the generated files (`ashravan.txt`, `dilemma.json`, `about.md`, `pelican.svg`, `restaurant.json`, `prediction.json`, `uid.txt`).
3.  The source code for `index.html` can be examined to understand how the links are structured.

## Technical Details

The core of this project relies on LLM generation for its content.

*   **Text Generation:** `ashravan.txt`, `about.md`, and `prediction.json` are produced by an LLM based on specific prompts.
*   **Data Structuring:** `dilemma.json` and `restaurant.json` are structured data outputs, formatted according to JSON specifications.
*   **Image Generation:** `pelican.svg` is an SVG file, likely generated by an LLM capable of producing vector graphics.
*   **Homepage:** `index.html` is a standard HTML file that serves as the navigation hub.
*   **Licensing:** The `LICENSE` file contains the text of the MIT License.
*   **Attachment:** `uid.txt` is included without modification.
